# zonia-design-system

The primary objective of this repository was to develop a versatile design system that could be utilized across various projects. The intention is to construct a design system that is as agnostic as possible when it comes to JavaScript frameworks. As the project progressed, I have realized that I'm recreating Tailwind CSS, and I also fully understood the advancements modern CSS technologies have made, making them superior to traditional CSS authoring methods.


### Conclusion
Writing SCSS was really fun ðŸ‘Œ
